# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
I built this project in order to learn and get accustomed to the world of coding. With no experience in coding at all, it really helped me get a small taste in what to expect and how to write basic commands and interact with my computer in a way I never thought I could. 
It helps students, like me, get a better understanding of terminologies and concepts of coding languages and how you can create something out of nothing. It encourages individuals to perservere and adopt a GROWTH mindset. 
I learned how to navigate through my computer's terminal, and to write commands via github and HTML whilst incorporating a little bit of CSS and JavaScript to display what I learned in a personalized expression via the web.

## Usage

This application can be used in order to learn a little bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. These are information that I personally deemed valuable to have a better understanding between each topics and to be informative catered to those with no coding experience like me. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
