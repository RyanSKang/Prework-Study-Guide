          <h2>HTML</h2> 
          <ul>
              <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the 3 cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS. HTML is used to create structure of a webpage. Made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web. </li>
              <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage</li>
              <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets</li>
              <li>Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, 2 elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the head and body elements</li>
              <ul>
                    <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage </li>
                    <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
              </ul>      
              <li>!DOCTYPE html declaration: this declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. !DOCTYPE html is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case sensitive</li>
              <li>The opening tag represents the root, or start, of our HTML document</li>
              <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. Furthermore, HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
              <li>The head element contains the metadata for our web application. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li> 
              <ul>
                <li>Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
              <li>Head element is a container for metadata. Meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user wont see information in the head or meta elements</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                    <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
              </ul>      
                <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as google or bing. Better SEO results in you website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>
              <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Git</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Github: Web interface for Git, a version control software that allows multiple people to make separate changes to a program at the same time without getting in the way of each other.</li>
              <li>Terminologies:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>Repository: Every project on Github is called a repository. A folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history</li>
                  <li>Branch: A Workspace where you can make changes that don’t affect the live site.Create a new branch for your work, and name it to best describe the work  </li>
                  <li>Markdown (.md): The way the content files are formatted in Github. A way to write for the web using plain text; easily converts to HTML</li>
                  <li>Commit Changes: Saving a new version of a file you are working on. Adds change to your branch</li>
                  <li>Pull Request (PR): Asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch. A way to discuss and review your work with others</li>
                  <li>Merge: When a Pull Request is approved, changes are "pulled in" or merged into the main branch. Changes are published or deployed to the live site once this happens</li>
                  <li>Issue: Way to report new tasks or content fixes. Track progress on project board, basically a to do list. Open an issue for a new task and close once done!</li>
              </ul>

              <li>Git Commands:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>git status: checks out what branch we are currently on</li>
                  <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
                  <li>git pull origin main: Allows you to be sure you are working with the most updated information within your branch</li>
                  <li>git push origin main: Allows you to update changes to your current branch</li>
              </ul>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Java Script (JS): A high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
              <li>JavaScript is CASE-Sensitive</li>
              <li>Variables: Containers that store values.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Start by declaring a variable with the “let” keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable</li>
                <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends (ex: let myVariable;). It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. It is good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement! </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Different Data Types:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>String: A sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks. (Ex: let myVariable = 'Bob'; or
                  let myVariable = "Bob";)</li>
                <li>Number: This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them. (Ex: let myVariable=10;)</li>
                <li>Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks. (Ex: let myVariable = true;)</li>
                <li>Array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference. (Ex: let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10]; Refer to each member of the array like this: myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.)</li>
                <li>Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. (Ex: let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');)</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Operators: An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
              <li>Conditionals: Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
              <li>Functions: A way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
              <li>Events:These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse.</li>
              <li>Dynamic and Weak Typing:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Dynamic: Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types</li>
                <li>Weak: It allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>JavaScript Keywords:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>To declare a variable, we use the “var” keyword, and after the key word, we give the variable a name. The name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code. </li>
                <li>Use an assignment operator “=” to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
                <li>Console.log method: Use to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Control Flow: The order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. Order of code affects the outcome!</li>
              <li>For Loop: A “for” loop sees the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>In order to use the for loop, we need the variable's index and the array's length. The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Contains three important statements:</li>
                <OL TYPE="i">
                <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 </li>
                <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running.</li>
                <Li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1.</Li>
              </ol>
              <li>Function: Simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. Functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. </li>
              <ul>
                <li>You must call a function by name in order to execute it. </li>
                <li>A function’s name is followed by parentheses.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
