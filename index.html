          <h2>HTML</h2> 
          <ul>
              <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the 3 cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS. HTML is used to create structure of a webpage. Made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web. </li>
              <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage</li>
              <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets</li>
              <li>Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, 2 elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the head and body elements</li>
              <ul>
                    <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage </li>
                    <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
              </ul>      
              <li>!DOCTYPE html declaration: this declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. !DOCTYPE html is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case sensitive</li>
              <li>The opening tag represents the root, or start, of our HTML document</li>
              <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. Furthermore, HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
              <li>The head element contains the metadata for our web application. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li> 
              <ul>
                <li>Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
              <li>Head element is a container for metadata. Meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user wont see information in the head or meta elements</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                    <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
              </ul>      
                <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as google or bing. Better SEO results in you website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>
              <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside </li>
          </ul>
